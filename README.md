#Introduction


A Natural Language Processing with SMS Data to predict whether the SMS is Spam/Ham with various ML Algorithms like multinomial-naive-bayes using various data cleaning and processing techniques like PorterStemmer,CountVectorizer,TFIDF Vetorizer,WordnetLemmatizer. It is implemented using LSTM and Word Embeddings to gain accuracy of 97.84%.


#Purpose
This spam identification system is used to detect weather the given data is spam or not.it gives 0 if the message is not spam else it gives the output as 1 as it indicates that the message is spam.
